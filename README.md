# BookShop_Website
A children's bookstore app developed using Ruby/SQL/Sinatra

This app enables a bookshop owner/worker to manage the shop's stock. This is not
an app for customers, but for shop employees only. The user can:

Show inventory pages listing the books and authors
Create books and authors
Show stock levels for the books (High/Medium/Low)
Add a buy and sell price to each stock item
Calculate the possible markup on items and show on inventory page

The details of the books and authors are kept in a SQL database and accessed via Ruby.
