# BookShop_Website
A children's bookshop web app developed using Ruby/SQL/Sinatra

This app enables a bookshop owner/worker to manage the shop's stock. This is not
an app for customers, but for shop employees only. The user can:

1) Show inventory pages listing the books and authors
2) Create books and authors
3) Show stock levels for the books (High/Medium/Low)
4) Add a buy and sell price to each stock item
5) Calculate the possible markup on items and show on inventory page

The details of the books and authors are kept in a SQL database and accessed via Ruby.
